      <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>3 tablespoons butter, divided</li>
        <li>1 small red onion, minced</li>
        <li>1 supermarket rotisserie chicken, minced and shredded</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon pepper</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of parsley finely chopped</li>
        <li>⅓ cup of flour</li>
        <li>1 cup milk</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 eggs, beaten</li>
        <li>2 cup breadcrumbs, or panko</li>
        <li>3 cup of oil for deep frying</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Steps</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Cooking chicken:</strong> Heat 1 tablespoon of butter over
          medium-low heat. Cook the onion stirring it until it turns translucent
          Stir in the chicken and stir until it is heated through. Season with
          pepper, and parsley. Set aside.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Cooking bechamel:</strong> Heat the remaining butter over
          medium-low heat until it's melted. Add the flour all at once and whisk
          vigorously until it's combined with the butter. Cook stirring for two
          minutes.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Forming the croquettes:</strong> There are two ways to form
          them. You can put the mixture in a pastry bag. Extrude it onto a
          greased tray or a tray lined with a silpat. Or form them one by one
          shaping them to the size of wine corks. Cover with plastic film and
          refrigerate for at least 3 hours.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Battering:</strong> Remove from the fridge. If you used a
          pastry bag, cut them into similar-sized croquettes. Dip the croquettes
          in the eggs, then cover with breadcrumbs. Cover and freeeze for 3
          hours, or refrigerate overnight.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Frying:</strong> Heat oil over high heat in a small saucepan .
          Remove the croquettes from the freezer and immediately Fry two by two
          until they turn golden brown. Rest on a paper towel to drain excess
          oil before serving.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Serving:</strong>  They are best served freshly fried, but you can serve within
          an hour at room temperature.
